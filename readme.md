## Description - 

The Virtual Greenhouse is an Unreal Engine-powered 3D simulation built using models designed in SketchUp. The system emulates a climate-responsive greenhouse with smart features such as:
Environmental control based on simulated sensor data
Dynamic visual feedback (HUD display, real-time day/night cycle)
A rules-based system for managing plant growth based on conditions


## Technologies Used

SketchUp:
Used for architectural modeling of the greenhouse, including structural layout, fans, vents, gas cylinders, water systems, and plant beds.
Unreal Engine:
Powered the real-time simulation with:
Blueprint visual scripting for climate control logic
Real-time rendering and lighting
Interactive HUD for displaying temperature, CO₂, and humidity
Simulated environment changes

## Key Features

Blueprint Logic for Climate Automation:
- Vents open when temperature > 26°C
Curtains adjust based on sunlight
- Fans and lamps controlled by virtual sensor data
Virtual Sensor & HUD Integration:
- Real-time UI shows environmental conditions
- Sensor-driven behavior simulates smart greenhouse systems
Tomato Growth Simulation:
- Growth logic based on light, temperature, and CO₂
- Users can experiment with environmental changes to observe effects
Day/Night Transitions:
- Dynamic lighting to simulate realistic time cycles

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained experience with:

Designing interactive simulations in Unreal Engine
Implementing environmental control systems using Blueprints
Managing 3D asset workflow between SketchUp and Unreal
Creating real-time UI using UMG HUD components
Simulating sensor-driven systems and understanding agricultural logic
